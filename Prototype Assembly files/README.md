Electric components:
- We used the soap pump housing, motor, motor battery, and soap pump system from a pre-existing electric soap dispenser
- 1 Arduino nano + usb cable
- 1 Arduino 12c clock module + battery
- 2 Mosfet
- 2 Phototresistor Sensors
- 2 100 Ohm resistors
- 2 10K Ohm resistors
- Wiring cables
- 10 000 mah powerbank
- Soldering board


Assembling the prototype electric components and pump system:
- Open the pre-existing electric soap dispenser casing and take out all parts exept the battery, motor and pump system
- Solder all electric components together as described in the electric components schematic picture in this folder
- Close the casing of the pre-existing soap dispenser to protect the parts
- Put the board with the microcontroller, the casing with the motor and the sensors into the box
- Attach the sensors to the right outer side of the box using glue at approx. 80% ROM
- Drill a whole on the left outer side of the box for the soap tube
- Connect the tube on the one side to the pump system on top
