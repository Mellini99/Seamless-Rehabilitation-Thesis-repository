This file contains the instructions on how to reproduce the assemply of the soap dispenser prototype. 

Tools:
- Soldering tools 
- Lasercutter
- Paint brushes
- Drill
- Saw
- Glue gun

Box Materials:
- Water-proof Wood Glue
- White water-repellent wood paint
- 2 elastic bands for mimicking resistance
- 4mm plywood for lasercutting box
- 2 little hooks to attach elastic bands
- Wooden stick with 2.5cm diameter and 1cm diameter for handle

Electric components:
- We used the soap pump housing, motor, motor battery, and soap pump system from a pre-existing electric soap dispenser
- 1 Arduino nano + usb cable
- 1 Arduino 12c clock module + battery
- 2 Mosfet
- 2 Phototresistor Sensors
- 2 100 Ohm resistors
- 2 10K Ohm resistors
- Wiring cables
- 10 000 mah powerbank
- Soldering board

First: Assembling the Outside Box:
- Lasercut the wood components out of 4mm plywood using the attached Box SVG file
- Sand the edges of the wood components
- Assemble the outside box and attach the wrist platform using water-proof wood glue
- Paint the outside box with water-repellent white paint and let dry
- Add 2 little hooks to the left and right on the front side of the box inside around the height of the lowest point of the half-circle cut-out
- Attach the elastic bands to the hooks

Second: Assemble the prototype electric components and pump system:
- Open the pre-existing electric soap dispenser casing and take out all parts exept the battery, motor and pump system
- Solder all electric components together as described in the electric components schematic picture in this folder
- Close the casing of the pre-existing soap dispenser to protect the parts
- Put the board with the microcontroller, the casing with the motor and the sensors into the box
- Attach the sensors to the right outer side of the box using glue at approx. 80% ROM
- Drill a hole on the left outer side of the box for the soap tube
- Drill a hole in the middle of the lid of the soap container
- Connect the tube on the one side to the pump system on top of the dispenser case
- Guide the tube on the other side through the whole in the box on the right outer side
- Guide the tube through the hole in the soap container lid until it reaches the bottom of the container 
- Use hot glue to secure the tube position on top of the dispenser case and to seal the tube on the container lid
- Attach the soap container to the outside of the box facing upwards and slighlty higher than the height of the pumping system 

Third: Assemble the inside box and handle
- Glue a thin rectangular wood piece on each of the inside walls just above the cut out facing the inside of the box
- Paint all inside box parts with white water-repellent paint
- Put in the inside walls of the prototype
- Glue the small rectangular top parts onto the inside walls to cover up the sensors
- Put in the inside bottom that covers up the soap dispenser and microcontroller in the bottom of the box
- Cut a wooden stick with 2.5 diameter to a length of 12 cm
- Cut two wooden sticks with 1cm diameter to a length of 5cm
- Drill a whole on both sides of the 2.5 diameter piece
- Assemble the handle inside the box, so that the 2.5 cm stick is in the middle and the 1cm sticks are stuck into the hole on each side and through the half-circle cut out
- Glue together with wood glue

Then the prototype is done!
